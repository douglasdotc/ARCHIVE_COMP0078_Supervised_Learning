# COMP0078 Supervised Learning - Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms
Summary:
* Compared time efficiency and accuracy of self-implemented Multi-class Kernel Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) by adjusting hyper-parameters using Python with ~9.3k handwritten digits
* Concluded that SVM has the lowest testing error (2.3%) but the slowest (5.9s/epoch) and kNN has the highest testing error (3.5%) but the fastest (2.4s/epoch) among the 3 algorithms using their best hyper-parameters
